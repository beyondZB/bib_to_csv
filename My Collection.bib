abstract = {Optimal determinization construction of Streett automata is an important research problem because it is indispensable in numerous applications such as decision problems for tree temporal logics, logic games and system synthesis. This paper presents a transformation from nondeterministic Streett automata (NSA) with n states and k Streett pairs to equivalent deterministic Rabin transition automata (DRTA) with n5n(n!)n states, O(nn2) Rabin pairs for k = $\omega$(n) and n5nknk states, O(knk) Rabin pairs for k = O(n). This improves the state of the art Streett determinization construction with n5n(n!)n+1 states, O(n2) Rabin pairs and n5nknkn! states, O(nk) Rabin pairs, respectively. Moreover, deterministic parity transition automata (DPTA) are obtained with 3(n(n + 1)-1)!(n!)n+1 states, 2n(n +1) priorities for k = $\omega$(n) and 3(n(k +1)-1)!n!knk states, 2n(k + 1) priorities for k = O(n), which improves the best construction with nn(k + 1)n(k+1)(n(k + 1)-1)! states, 2n(k + 1) priorities. Further, we prove a lower bound state complexity for determinization construction from N-SA to deterministic Rabin (transition) automata i.e. n5n(n!)n for k = $\omega$(n) and n5nknk for k = O(n), which matches the state complexity of the proposed determinization construction. Besides, we put forward a lower bound state complexity for determinization construction from NSA to deterministic parity (transition) automata i.e. 2$\omega$(n2 log n) for k = $\omega$(n) and 2$\omega$(nk log nk) for k = O(n), which is the same as the state complexity of the proposed determinization construction in the exponent.},

abstract = {The main result of this paper is that computing the value of a one-clock priced timed game (OCPTG) is PSPACE-hard. Along the way, we provide a family of OCPTGs that have an exponential number of event points. Both results hold even in very restricted classes of games such as DAGs with treewidth three. Finally, we provide a number of positive results, including polynomial-time algorithms for even more restricted classes of OCPTGs such as trees.},

@article{Sheng2019,
abstract = {Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) that has been standardized and widely used in industry. Multithreaded discrete event simulation language (MDESL) is a Verilog-like language. It contains interesting features such as event-driven computation and shared-variable concurrency. This article considers how the algebraic semantics links with the operational semantics for MDESL. Our approach is from both the theoretical and practical aspects. The link is proceeded by deriving the operational semantics from the algebraic semantics. First, we present the algebraic semantics for MDESL. We introduce the concept of head normal form. Second, we present the strategy of deriving operational semantics from algebraic semantics.We also investigate the soundness and completeness of the derived operational semantics with respect to the derivation strategy. Our theoretical approach is complemented by a practical one, and we use the theorem proof assistant Coq to formalize the algebraic laws and the derived operational semantics. Meanwhile, the soundness and completeness of the derived operational semantics is also verified via the mechanical approach in Coq. Our approach is a novel way to formalize and verify the correctness and equivalence of different semantics for MDESL in both a theoretical approach and a practical approach.},
